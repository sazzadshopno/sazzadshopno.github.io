    "description": "My love for technology and problem-solving started at a young age, and I have been working towards a career in computer science and engineering ever since. Throughout my academic journey, I have been dedicated to developing my skills and knowledge in the field and have been actively seeking opportunities to put my skills to the test. As a highly motivated and driven individual, I take great pride in my work and am always looking for ways to improve. This is reflected in my academic record, where I earned a CGPA of 3.50 in my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from the Institute of Science and Technology. During my studies, I was actively involved in competitive programming, participating in ICPC Dhaka Regional in 2018 and 2019, and becoming a champion in an Intra University Programming Contest. These experiences allowed me to test my abilities, build my confidence, and further solidify my passion for the field. My practical experience in the field of software engineering has been just as impressive. As a software engineer at bKash Limited, I have been able to put my skills and knowledge to the test, working on challenging projects and developing my expertise in Dart, Flutter, Javascript, NodeJS, Java, and Springboot. I have also developed a strong understanding of tools such as Git, Jira, Confluence, and Slack, which are critical in today's fast-paced software development environment. In my current role, I bring a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a commitment to producing high-quality results. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I always strive to exceed expectations and to make a meaningful impact in everything that I do. This is why I am now pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Daffodil International University. This degree will allow me to take my skills and knowledge to the next level, and to stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing field. I believe that my academic background, practical experience, and commitment to excellence make me a valuable asset to any organization. I am eager to bring my skills, knowledge, and passion to a challenging and rewarding role in the field of computer science and engineering and to continue making a positive impact in the world.",
